LineChart-package
=================

This is a simple package that plots line charts in R. The introductory vignettes are in the `/doc` folder in pdf and html form. It's just a few pages and describes pretty much the whole package.

Installation
------------

This package can be installed directly from this repository with the following commands in R:
```{r}
#install.packages("devtools") #Uncomment if you don't have devtools installed
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hardmanko/LineChart-package")
```

To just test the package without installing it, you can simply source `./R/LineChart-functions.R`, which also contains all of the functions and the documentation as comments.
