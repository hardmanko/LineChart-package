Description: This package is for plotting standard line charts for data for
    which there is a continuous dependent variable, a continuous independent
    variable, and an optional categorical independent variable. For example, 
    you might want to plot height as a function of age for males and females.
    The plotting functions have a simple formula interface that allow you to
    directly provide your data and a formula of the form "y ~ x * group". Your
    data will be aggregated based on the formula and the means plotted, with
    optional error bars. The primary function in this package is called lineChart.
    With this package, you can easily specify the appearance of the groups so
    as to allow easy visual interpretation of the figure. The settings for the
    groups include the ability to set the symbol, color, and line type and width
    for the groups, among other things.
