Description: Plots standard line charts for data for which there is a
        continuous dependent variable, a continuous independent variable,
        and optional categorical independent variables. For example, you
        might want to plot height as a function of age for males and
        females. The primary plotting function, lineChart, has a formula
        interface that allows you to provide your data and a formula of
        the form "y ~ x * g1 * g2 * ... * gK", where "y" is your dependent
        variable, "x" is a categorical or continuous independent variable,
        and "gN" are categorical grouping variables. Your data will be
        aggregated based on the formula and the means ploted. The groups
        will be given default appearances which make them visually
        discriminable, or the user can supply appearance information,
        including color, plotting symbol, and line type, among others.
        Optionally, a legend will be plotted at a specified location,
        using the appearance information that was used for plotting to
        create the legend appearance. Standard deviation, standard error,
        or 95% confidence interval error bars can be calculated
        automatically. This package is specialized for making line charts
        and as a result is quite easy to use for that purpose.
